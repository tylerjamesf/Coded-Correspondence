## Overview

This project is a departure from the typical step-by-step tutorials on Codecademy. Instead, it presents a series of open-ended requirements to build a unique cryptography project. You'll be diving into the world of cryptography as you decipher and encode messages in your correspondence with a friend. This project is an exciting opportunity to put your Python skills to the test while having fun with cryptography puzzles.

## Project Goals

There are a number of encoded messages within letters back and forth from a friend. The objectives for this project include:

1. **Decipher Messages**: You'll need to decipher the encoded messages provided. These messages will be in various formats, and your Python skills will be crucial in unveiling their secrets.

2. **Encode Responses**: To continue the cryptographic exchange, you must encode your own responses. This will require you to implement encoding algorithms to protect your messages.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```
coded-correspondence/

â”œâ”€â”€ caeser_decode.py           # Python script for deciphering Caesar Cipher messages
â”œâ”€â”€ caeser_encode.py           # Python script for encoding Caesar Cipher responses
â”œâ”€â”€ vigenere_decode.py           # Python script for deciphering VigenÃ¨re Cipher messages
